# Project Management App

## Overview
This is a Flutter application designed for project management, aiming to provide a comprehensive solution for users to create, manage, and evaluate projects efficiently. The app includes essential features such as QR code scanning for quick evaluations, project creation forms, and a user-friendly interface. Utilizing the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management, the app is built to be scalable and maintainable.

## Features
- **QR Code Scanner**: Users can scan QR codes to quickly access project evaluations, streamlining the evaluation process.
- **Add Project Screen**: A dedicated screen that allows users to create new projects by entering a user ID and an end date.
- **Edit Project Screen**: Enables users to modify existing projects, with any changes automatically reflected in the backend API.
- **Custom Add Card**: A reusable UI component designed for adding tasks, featuring a modern design aesthetic.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices using the Sizer package.
- **API Integration**: The app fetches, creates, and updates project data from a remote server using robust API calls, facilitating smooth communication between the app and the backend.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories for better maintainability and readability:

- **data_layer/**: Contains the data management code, such as `data_layer.dart`, which handles data retrieval and storage.
- **networking/**: Responsible for API communication, including `api_networking.dart` where all API calls are defined.
- **services/**: Manages initialization and dependency injection, with files like `setup.dart` for configuring services.
- **screens/**: This directory holds various screens of the application:
  - `Auth/first_screen.dart`: The initial screen where users can log in or register.
  - `Evaluation/evaluation_screen.dart`: Displays the project evaluation results after scanning a QR code.
  - `QR_scanner/`: Contains the functionality and UI components for scanning QR codes.
  - `AddProjectScreen.dart`: A screen dedicated to adding new projects.
  - `EditProjectScreen.dart`: A screen for editing existing projects.
  - `User/user_dashboard.dart`: Dashboard specifically designed for user-related functionalities.
  - `Admin/admin_dashboard.dart`: A dashboard for managing admin functionalities, including user management and project oversight.
  - `Supervisor/supervisor_dashboard.dart`: Dashboard for supervisors to manage projects and oversee user submissions.
- **widgets/**: Contains reusable UI components like `custom_add_card.dart` that can be used across different screens.
- **main.dart**: This is the entry point of the application, where the app is initialized and run.

## API Usage
The application interacts with a backend server through a series of API calls. These calls are essential for managing projects and user roles. Here's a detailed breakdown of the API interactions:

### Fetching Projects
- **GET /api/projects**: This endpoint retrieves a list of all projects stored on the server. It is used when users want to view available projects in the app.

### Creating Projects
- **POST /api/projects**: This endpoint allows Supervisor to create a new project. The request body must include necessary details such as user ID and end date. This is used in the Add Project Screen.

### Editing Projects
- **PUT /api/projects/{id}**: Users can modify an existing project by sending a PUT request to this endpoint, replacing `{id}` with the specific project ID. The request body should contain the updated project details.

### User Role Management
The application supports three user rolesâ€”Admin, Supervisor, and Userâ€”each with specific functionalities managed via API calls:
- **Admin**: Can create, update, and delete any project. Admins have complete access to all API functionalities.
- **Supervisor**: Can add new projects and oversee user contributions. Supervisors can manage project status and monitor progress through API endpoints.
- **User**: Users can edit projects assigned to them and submit changes. Their interactions with projects are also managed through API calls to ensure data integrity.

### Email Verification
- **OTP Service**: The app includes a feature for email verification, where a One-Time Password (OTP) is sent to the userâ€™s email during the registration process. This ensures that users have access to their email accounts before they can log in.
